# Hedra Library
## What is Hedra?
_Hedra_ is the plural to _hedron_, meaning face of a geometrical solid object. It may also mean chair, seat or base.

This library was born from the need to collect all useful, _basic_ functionality I might program regarding 2D and 3D spaces. These are the methods and functions I always need and program time and time again, trying to get as efficient as time will allow.

## What does it contain?
[WIP]

## Dependencies
Hedra is divided in several modules, some of which are dependant on others. You can delete the ones you don't need. 

Here is an image of the dependencies, to help you choose which ones to download:

## How can I use it?
This code was developed in Unity using C#. You can just download it to your Unity project. 
Should you want to use Hedra outside of Unity, you might need to do some refactoring, as Vectors 2 and 3 are used, and these are UnityEngine's data structures. However, please, let me know if that is the case for you. I will try my best to make it suitable for your engine.
